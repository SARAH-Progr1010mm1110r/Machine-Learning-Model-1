# Machine-Learning-Model-1
### **Perform feature engineering techniques on the Titanic Dataset**

* Create a Logistic Regression using the titanic dataset.
* Start by making a model that only uses numerical features and predicts the "survived" column.
* Make different models utilizing the feature engineering techniques learned in class.
* Compare your results between validation and test cost functions and report the percent difference between them.
* Save your model using Joblib.

* **Feature Engineering:**
   * One-Hot Encoder
   * Ordinal Encoder
